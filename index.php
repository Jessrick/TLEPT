<h3 align ="left"> What are coronaviruses? </h2>
<p> Coronaviruses are a large family of zoonotic viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to severe respiratory diseases. Zoonotic means these viruses are able to be transmitted from animals to humans. There are several coronaviruses known to be circulating in different animal populations that have not yet infected humans. COVID-19 is the most recent to make the jump to human infection.
Common signs of COVID-19 infection are similar to the common cold and include respiratory symptoms such as dry cough, fever, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and death.
The COVID-19 infection is spread from one person to others via droplets produced from the respiratory system of infected people, often during coughing or sneezing. According to current data, time from exposure to onset of symptoms is usually between two and 14 days, with an average of five days.

<p> <font size ="5"> "Only if we help one another, hope will surely come." </font> </p>
<p> <font size ="3"> Based on our illustration, we used a flower as a symbol of hope because it is said that “Hope is the consequence of action” the same as a flower in which you need to act upon it in order for that flower to grow. Another reason on why we choose a flower as a symbol is because of its synonyms to love. Love and hope go together so well and in spite of the COVID 19, people never lose hope and love for one another. We just really need to love, care, and hope for one another in order to overcome this challenge for a bright and positive future ahead of us just like on what a gardener treats its plants in order for a flower to bloom.
